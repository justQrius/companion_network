## Executive Summary

**Vision:** A network of personal AI agents that communicate with each other to coordinate plans (like dinner) on behalf of their humans, eliminating the "coordination tax".
**Target Users:** General consumers (demonstrated with Alice and Bob).
**Core Experience:** User says "Plan dinner with Bob", and the AIs negotiate availability and preferences in the background, presenting a final option for approval.
**Platform:** Web-based Gradio Demo (Split-screen desktop view).
**Desired Feeling:** Relief and Empowerment.
**Design Vibe:** Clean, minimal, chat-centric (like ChatGPT/Claude).

## 1. Design System Foundation

### 1.1 Design System Choice

### 1.1 Design System Choice

**Selected System:** Gradio `Base` Theme + Custom CSS
**Style:** Clean & Minimal
**Rationale:** Aligns with the "invisible UI" goal, keeping focus on the conversation and network logs. Similar aesthetic to modern LLM interfaces like Claude or ChatGPT.
**Customization Needs:** Minimal custom CSS to remove default container borders and enhance typography for readability.
